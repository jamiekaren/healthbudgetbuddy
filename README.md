# Health Budget Buddy - React Version!

[https://healthbudgetbuddy.herokuapp.com/](https://healthbudgetbuddy.herokuapp.com/)

In today's world, we put a new-found high value on our physical and mental health. A large part of this comes from the food we consume. But with how busy our lives our, how do we make sure we're eating the fruits and vegetables we need?

_Better yet, how do we even afford these things?_

**Health Budget Buddy** was born from the desire to eat healthy, while understanding how to do so in the real world where our budgets and paycheck may not always support it. Not only will Health Budget Buddy help enable you to live a better life both physically and mentally, you won't have to drastically change your routine to do so.

We do this by taking small steps. This starts by adding fruits and vegetable servings to whatever you're currently eating for the day. With our app, you can capture up to 5 days of these servings based on how much you'd like to spend.

Better yet, you can even have this list sent to you via a text message. Next time you're in the grocery store, your list is right there for you. 

**Sign up today to start making so small steps tomorrow.**
